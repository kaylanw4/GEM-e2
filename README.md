# Polaris GEM-e2 Lane Navigation

Group Members: Chun Mao Lai, Kaylan Wang, Vishvesh Padmakumar

## Final project for ECE 484 @ UIUC for the Fall 2023 semester

In this project we developed a lane keeping algorithm for the GEM car in the simulated environment and then implemented a slightly modified version of the algorithm on the car in the real world. We were able to autonomously navigate the entire track at the Highbay facility @ UIUC using our algorithm implemented on the GEM-e2 vehicle.
